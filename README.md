## CATPHOTOAPP

This HTML code is for a webpage called "CatPhotoApp". The webpage is divided into three main sections: "Cat Photos", "Cat Lists", and "Cat Form". 

In the "Cat Photos" section, there is a header with the title of the webpage ("CatPhotoApp") and a subheader for "Cat Photos". The section includes a link to view more cat photos in a gallery, as well as an image of a cute orange cat lying on its back. 

The "Cat Lists" section includes two subheaders, "Things cats love" and "Top 3 things cats hate". There is a list of three items that cats love, followed by an image of lasagna with a caption that says "Cats love lasagna". Then, there is a list of three things that cats hate, followed by an image of five cats in a field with a caption that says "Cats hate other cats".

The "Cat Form" section includes a subheader for "Cat Form" and a form with two fieldsets. The first fieldset includes a legend and two radio buttons, one for "Indoor" and one for "Outdoor". The second fieldset includes a legend and three checkboxes for a cat's personality traits: "Loving", "Lazy", and "Energetic". The form also includes a text input for a cat photo URL and a submit button.

At the bottom of the webpage, there is a footer that includes a statement about no copyright and a link to freeCodeCamp.org.

This code can be used to create a webpage for a cat-related app or service. The code can be edited and customized to fit the specific needs of the webpage.
